#### _{A small app to review Express middleware}, {11/1/2017}_

#### By _**{Chris Underwood}**_

## Description

_{An application that takes in a single numerical value, triples it, and shows it on the screen.The purpose of this app is really to explore middleware patterns such as require and moving middle ware apps off the main app.js page into their own modules. }_

## Setup/Installation Requirements


_{Download the files and migrate to the folder where the files reside via the terminal. Run npm install from the command line. Install and run nodemon to keep node.js updating without having to do manual reboots.}_

## Known Bugs

_{Once in an error by putting in the wrong kind of value, the app does not do a good job in letting the user out of the loop. Best bet is reloading the app by putting a '/' at the end of the url and hitting enter to reset. }_

## Support and contact details

_{cunderwoodmn [at] gmail {dot} com}_

## Technologies Used

_{HTML5, CSS3, vanilla-JS, node.js, Express, bodyParser}_
